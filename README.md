In this repository, I have an Arithmatic Expression infix to postfix converter where I used enum data type to deal with the Operators and Partheses and also use stacks to keep track of the operators; moreover, I used StringBuilder class to build the expression. I also have an evaluator for this expression that evaluates the expression from it's postfix format and provides the accurate value.
